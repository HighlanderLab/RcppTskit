# STATE of the tree sequence ecosystem and AIMS for `RcppTskit`

## STATE of the tree sequence ecosystem

The tree sequence ecosystem is rapidly evolving (see https://tskit.dev). There are now multiple packages supporting generation of tree sequences and there is a growing number of APIs for analysing them. This is a quick summary of the state of the ecosystem as of December 2025.

  * `tskit` (https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs, https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit) is the core tree sequence toolkit. It has a C API and Python API. Python API is popular entry point for most users. There is also a Rust API that interfaces the C API.

  * `msprime` (https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs, https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime) generates tree sequences with backward in time simulation. It has Python API and command line interface.

  * `SLiM` (https://messerlab.org/slim, https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM) generates tree sequences with forward in time simulation. It is written in C++ (with embedded `tskit` C library) and has command line and GUI interface. It's tree sequence recording is described in great detail at https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM/blob/master/treerec/implementation.md.

  * `pyslim` (https://tskit.dev/pyslim/docs, https://github.com/tskit-dev/pyslim) provides a Python API for reading and modifying `tskit` tree sequence files produced by SLiM, or modifying files produced by other programs (e.g., msprime) for use in SLiM.

  * `fwdpy11` (https://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpy11, https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpy11) generates tree sequences with forward in time simulation. It has a Python API, which is built on C++ API (`fwdpp`).

  * `stdpopsim` (https://popsim-consortium.github.io/stdpopsim-docs, https://github.com/popsim-consortium/stdpopsim) is a standard library of population genetic models used in simulations with `msprime` and `SLiM`. It has Python API and command line interface.

  * `slendr` (https://bodkan.net/slendr, https://github.com/bodkan/slendr) is an R package for describing population genetic models, simulating them with either `msprime` or `SLiM`, and analysing resulting tree sequences using `tskit`. It calls `msprime`, `pyslim`, and `tskit` via `reticulate` R package (that enables calling Python from within R), while it calls `SLiM` via R `system()/shell()` function. It implemented R wrappers for a number of `tskit` functions, such as `ts_read()`, `ts_write()`, `ts_simplify()`, `ts_mutate()`, etc. The wrappers call Python functions (via `reticulate`) and perform additional actions required for integration with R and `slendr` functionality.

  * `slimr` (https://rdinnager.github.io/slimr, https://github.com/rdinnager/slimr) provides an R API for specifying and running SLiM scripts and analysing results in R. It runs `SLiM` via R package `processx`.

  * `tsinfer` (https://tskit.dev/tsinfer/docs, https://github.com/tskit-dev/tsinfer) generates tree sequence from observed genomic (haplotype) data. It has Python API and command line interface.

As described above, the tree sequence ecosystem is extensive. Python is the most widely used and complete interface for simulation and analysis of tree sequences.

There is an interest for work with tree sequences in R. Because we can call Python from within R with `reticulate`, there is no pressing need for a dedicated R support for work with tree sequences. See https://tskit.dev/tutorials/tskitr.html on how this looks like and further details at https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate. In a way, this situation will positively focus the community on the Python collection of packages. While there are differences between R and Python, many R users will be able to follow the extensive `tskit` Python API documentation and examples. For example, the `reticulate` approach of working with tree sequences from within R looks like this:

TODO: Move reticulate code to an external file (since it's quite long)? #28
      https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/issues/28

```
# install.packages("reticulate")

reticulate::py_require("msprime")
# msprime and tskit Python API calls from within R via reticulate
msprime <- reticulate::import("msprime")
ts <- msprime$sim_ancestry(10, sequence_length = 100, recombination_rate = 0.1)

G <- ts$genotype_matrix()
str(G)
# int [1:54, 1:4] 0 0 0 0 0 ...

# --> a simple object (like a NumPy array) is converted to an R object

#     https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/arrays.html

# G is an R matrix object so we can use R functions on it
allele_frequency <- rowMeans(G)
allele_frequency
```

To provide idiomatic R interface to some population genetic simulation steps and operations with tree sequences, `slendr` implemented bespoke functions and wrapper functions that call Python packages and their functions via `reticulate`. As such, `slendr` further lowers barriers for R users. For example, the `slendr/reticulate` approach of working with tree sequences from within R looks like this:

TODO: Move slendr/reticulate example to an external file (since it's quite long)? #27
     https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/issues/27

```
# install.packages("slendr")

model <- read_model(path = mode_file)
print(model)
# slendr 'model' object
# ---------------------

...

afr <- model$populations[["AFR"]]
eur <- model$populations[["EUR"]]
samples <- schedule_sampling(model, times = 0, list(afr, 10), list(eur, 100))
ts <- msprime(model, sequence_length = 100, recombination_rate = 0.001,
  samples = samples)

```

One downside of using `reticulate` is the overhead of calling Python functions. This overhead is minimal for most analyses - these call a few functions, which do all the work, looping, etc. on Python side, often calling `tskit`'s C API). However, the overhead can be limiting for repeated calling of `tskit` functions, say for tree sequence recording in an R session/package. Note, that while metadata is available in C and Python APIs, it's encoding/decoding is only available in Python API, though `SLiM` does something of it's own in C++!

## AIMS for `RcppTskit`

Given the above state of the tree sequence ecosystem, the aims of the `RcppTskit` package are to provide an easy to install and use R package that enables users to:
  1) Load a tree sequence into R and summarise it,
  2) Pass tree sequence between R and reticulate or standard Python,
  3) Call `tskit` C API in C++ code in R session or script, and
  4) Call `tskit` C API in C++ code in another R package.

You can see examples for all of these in `vignette(TODO)` and
for 1-3) also in in `?RcppTskit`.

TODO: Move all these example codes and outputs into vignette
      https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/issues/10

```
# Install RcppTskit
remotes::install_github(repo = "HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/RcppTskit")

# Load RcppTskit and print tskit version
library(RcppTskit)
tskit_version()
# major minor patch
#     1     3     0
```

### 1) Load a tree sequence into R and summarise it

Here is an example:

```
# Load a tree sequence
ts_file <- system.file("examples/test.trees", package = "RcppTskit")
ts <- ts_load(ts_file)
ts
# <pointer: 0x1236b4220>
# TODO: Rename ts_load() to ts_load_ptr() and create ts_load() returning
#       S3/S4/R6/... object #22
#       https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/issues/22

# Print summary of the tree sequence
ts_print(ts)
# $ts
#          property       value
# 1     num_samples         160
# 2 sequence_length       10000
# 3       num_trees          26
# 4      time_units generations
# 5    has_metadata       FALSE
#
# $tables
#         table number has_metadata
# 1 provenances      2           NA
# 2 populations      1         TRUE
# 3  migrations      0        FALSE
# ...
```

### 2) Pass tree sequence between R and reticulate or standard Python

Here is an example:

```
# Tree sequence in R
ts_file <- system.file("examples/test.trees", package = "RcppTskit")
ts <- ts_load(ts_file)

# If you have a tree sequence in R and you want to use tskit Python API,
# you can write it to disk and load it into reticulate Python
ts_py <- ts_r_to_py(ts)
# ... continue in reticulate Python ...
ts_py$num_individuals # 160
ts2_py = ts_py$simplify(samples = c(0L, 1L, 2L, 3L))
ts2_py$num_individuals # 2
# ... and to bring it back to R ...
ts2 <- ts_py_to_r(ts2_py)
ts_num_individuals(ts2) # 2

# If you prefer standard (non-reticulate) Python, use this
ts_file <- tempfile()
print(ts_file)
ts_dump(ts, file = ts_file)
# ... continue in standard Python ...
# import tskit
# ts = tskit.load("insert_ts_file_path_here")
# ts.num_individuals # 80
# ts2 = ts.simplify(samples = [0, 1, 2, 3])
# ts2.num_individuals # 2
# ts2.dump("insert_ts_file_path_here")
# ... and to bring it back to R ...
ts2 <- ts_load(ts_file)
ts_num_individuals(ts2) # 2
```

### 3) Call `tskit` C API in C++ code in R session or script

Here is an example:

```
# Load packages
library(RcppTskit)
library(Rcpp)

# Write and compile a C++ function
codeString <- '
  #include <tskit.h>
  int ts_num_individuals(SEXP ts) {
    int n;
    Rcpp::XPtr<tsk_treeseq_t> xptr(ts);
    n = (int) tsk_treeseq_get_num_individuals(xptr);
    return n;
  }'
ts_num_individuals2 <- cppFunction(code = codeString,
  depends = "RcppTskit", plugins = "RcppTskit")
# We must specify both the `depends` and `plugins` arguments!

# Load a tree sequence
ts_file <- system.file("examples/test.trees", package = "RcppTskit")
ts <- ts_load(ts_file)

# Apply the compiled function
ts_num_individuals2(ts)
# [1] 80

# An identical RcppTskit implementation
ts_num_individuals(ts)
# [1] 80
```

### 4) Call `tskit` C API in C++ code in another R package

TODO: Move these details to a vignette!?
      https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/issues/10

Follow the steps below in your R package. To see details of each step, see the files in R package `AlphaSimR` at this [commit](https://github.com/HighlanderLab/AlphaSimR/commit/12657b08e7054d88bc214413d13f36c7cde60d95) (that has a proof of concept of using `tskit` C API via `RcppTskit`).

a) Open `DESCRIPTION` file and add `RcppTskit` to the `LinkingTo:` field.

b) Add `#include <tskit.h>` as needed to your C++ header files in `src` directory.

c) Call `tskit` C API as needed in your C++ code in `src` directory.

d) Configure your package build to use the `RcppTskit` library file using the following steps:

  * Add `src/Makevars.in` and `src/Makevars.win.in` files with `PKG_LIB = @RCPPTSKIT_LIB@` flag, in addition to other flags.

  * Add `tools/configure.R` file, which will replace `@RCPPTSKIT_LIB@` in `src/Makevars.in` and `src/Makevars.win.in` files with the installed `RcppTskit` library file, including appropriate flags, and generate `src/Makevars` and `src/Makevars.win`.

  * Add `configure` and `configure.win` scripts (and make them executable) to call `tools/configure.R`.

  * Add `cleanup` and  `cleanup.win` scripts (and make them executable) to remove `src/Makevars` and `src/Makevars.win` as well as compilation files.

e) You should now be ready to build, check, and install your package using tools like `devtools::build()`, `devtools::check()`, and `devtools::install()` or their `R CMD` equivalents.

Here is an example:

```
# Install AlphaSimR
# (Commit with a proof of concept of using tskit C API;
#  study the file contents in there! Can also use later commits.)
remotes::install_github(
  repo = "HighlanderLab/AlphaSimR",
  ref = "12657b08e7054d88bc214413d13f36c7cde60d95"
)

# Load packages
library(RcppTskit)
library(AlphaSimR)

# Load tree sequence and count the number of individuals
ts_file <- system.file("examples/test.trees", package = "RcppTskit")
ts <- ts_load(ts_file)
RcppTskit::ts_num_individuals(ts)
AlphaSimR::ts_num_individuals2(ts)
```
