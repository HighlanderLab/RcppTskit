# STATE of the tree sequence ecosystem and AIMS for `tskitr`

## STATE of the tree sequence ecosystem

The tree sequence ecosystem is rapidly evolving (see https://tskit.dev). There are now multiple packages supporting generation of tree sequences and there is a growing number of APIs for analysing them. This is a quick summary of the state of the ecosystem as of December 2025.

  * `tskit` (https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs, https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit) is the core tree sequence toolkit. It has a C API and Python API. Python API is popular entry point for most users. There is also a Rust API that interfaces the C API.

  * `msprime` (https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs, https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime) generates tree sequences with backward in time simulation. It has Python API and command line interface.

  * `SLiM` (https://messerlab.org/slim, https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM) generates tree sequences with forward in time simulation. It is written in C++ (with embedded `tskit` C library) and has command line and GUI interface. It's tree sequence recording is described in great detail at https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM/blob/master/treerec/implementation.md.

  * `pyslim` (https://tskit.dev/pyslim/docs, https://github.com/tskit-dev/pyslim) provides a Python API for reading and modifying `tskit` tree sequence files produced by SLiM, or modifying files produced by other programs (e.g., msprime) for use in SLiM.

  * `fwdpy11` (https://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpy11, https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpy11) generates tree sequences with forward in time simulation. It has a Python API, which is built on C++ API (`fwdpp`).

  * `stdpopsim` (https://popsim-consortium.github.io/stdpopsim-docs, https://github.com/popsim-consortium/stdpopsim) is a standard library of population genetic models used in simulations with `msprime` and `SLiM`. It has Python API and command line interface.

  * `slendr` (https://bodkan.net/slendr, https://github.com/bodkan/slendr) is an R package for describing population genetic models, simulating them with either `msprime` or `SLiM`, and analysing resulting tree sequences using `tskit`. It calls `msprime`, `pyslim`, and `tskit` via R package `reticulate` (that enables calling Python from within R), while it calls `SLiM` via R `system()/shell()` function. It implemented R wrappers for a number of `tskit` functions, such as `ts_read()`, `ts_write()`, `ts_simplify()`, `ts_mutate()`, etc. The wrappers call Python functions (via reticulate) and perform additional actions required for integration with R and `slendr` functionality.

  * `slimr` (https://rdinnager.github.io/slimr, https://github.com/rdinnager/slimr) provides an R API for specifying and running SLiM scripts and analysing results in R. It runs `SLiM` via R package `processx`.

  * `tsinfer` (https://tskit.dev/tsinfer/docs, https://github.com/tskit-dev/tsinfer) generates tree sequence from observed genomic (haplotype) data. It has Python API and command line interface.

As described above, the tree sequence ecosystem is extensive. Python is the most widely used and complete interface for simulation and analysis of tree sequences.

There is an interest for work with tree sequences in R. Because we can call Python from within R with `reticulate`, there is no pressing need for a dedicated R support for work with tree sequences. See https://tskit.dev/tutorials/tskitr.html on how this looks like and further details at https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate. In a way, this situation will positively focus the community on the Python collection of packages. While there are some differences between R and Python, many R users will be able to work with the extensive Python documentation and examples. For example, the reticulate-based-calls from within R look like this:

TODO: Move reticulate code to an external file (since it's quite long)? #28
      https://github.com/HighlanderLab/tskitr/issues/28

```
# install.packages(c("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
reticulate::py_require("msprime")
# msprime and tskit Python API calls from within R via reticulate
msprime <- reticulate::import("msprime")
ts <- msprime$sim_ancestry(10, sequence_length=100, recombination_rate=0.1)
is(ts)

#     and is wrapped by an R object

G <- ts$genotype_matrix()
str(G)
# int [1:54, 1:5] 0 0 0 0 0 ...

#     https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/#type-conversions
#     https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/arrays.html

# G is an R matrix object so we can use R functions on it
allele_frequency <- rowMeans(G)
allele_frequency
```

To provide idiomatic R interface to some population genetic simulation steps and operations with tree sequences, `slendr` implemented bespoke functions and wrapper functions that use `reticulate` to call Python packages and their functions. This further lowers barriers for R users. For example, the code calls from within R look like this:

TODO: Move slendr/reticulate example to an external file (since it's quite long)? #27
     https://github.com/HighlanderLab/tskitr/issues/27

```
# install.packages(c("slendr"))
library(slendr)
# setup_env() # run in the first session
init_env() # run in future sessions
model <- read_model(path=system.file("extdata/models/introgression",
  package="slendr"))
print(model)
# slendr 'model' object
# ---------------------
# populations: CH, AFR, NEA, EUR
...

afr <- model$populations[["AFR"]]
eur <- model$populations[["EUR"]]
samples <- schedule_sampling(model, times=0, list(afr, 10), list(eur, 100))
ts <- msprime(model, sequence_length=100, recombination_rate=0.001,
  samples=samples)

```

One downside of using `reticulate` is the overhead of calling Python functions, which can add up if they are called many times, say within an R loop. This overhead is minimal for most analyses as these would call a few functions, so most of the work, looping, etc. is done on Python side, often in `tskit`'s C code). However, the overhead can be limiting for repeated calling of `tskit` functions, say for tree sequence recording and bespoke analyses (though ideally these would be implemented in Python and possibly ported to C/C++). Importantly, metadata functionality is only available in Python, though `SLiM` does something of it's own

## AIMS for `tskitr`

Given the above state of the tree sequence ecosystem, the aims of the `tskitr` package are to:
  1) Load a tree sequence into an R session and summarise it,
  2) Call `tskit` C API in C++ code in an R session,
  3) Call `tskit` C API in C++ code in another R package, and
  4) Call `tskit` C API in R code in an R session or another R package (TODO). #12 https://github.com/HighlanderLab/tskitr/issues/12

The following subsections demonstrate how this functionality looks like.

### 1) Load a tree sequence into an R session and summarise it

Here is an example:

```
# Install tskitr
remotes::install_github(repo = "HighlanderLab/tskitr/tskitr")

# Load tskitr and print tskit version
library(tskitr)
tskit_version()
# major minor patch
#     1     3     0

# Load a tree sequence
ts_file <- system.file("examples/test.trees", package="tskitr")
ts <- tskitr::ts_load(ts_file) # slendr also has ts_load()!
ts
# <pointer: 0x1236b4220>

# Summarise
ts_num(ts)
# $num_provenances
# [1] 2
# $num_populations
# [1] 1
# $num_migrations
# [1] 0
# $num_individuals
# [1] 80
...
ts_num_individuals(ts)
# [1] 80
?ts_num
# see the implemented ts_num_x() functions
```

TODO: Create a summary()/print() method for ts? #26
      https://github.com/HighlanderLab/tskitr/issues/26

TODO: Do we need/want any other summary functions/methods on ts? #25
      https://github.com/HighlanderLab/tskitr/issues/25

### 2) Call `tskit` C API in C++ code in an R session

Here is an example:

```
# Install tskitr
remotes::install_github(repo = "HighlanderLab/tskitr/tskitr")

# Load packages
library(Rcpp)
library(tskitr)

# Write and compile a C++ function
codeString <- '
  #include <tskit.h>
  int ts_num_individuals(SEXP ts) {
    int n;
    Rcpp::XPtr<tsk_treeseq_t> xptr(ts);
    n = (int) tsk_treeseq_get_num_individuals(xptr);
    return n;
  }'
ts_num_individuals2 <- cppFunction(code=codeString, depends="tskitr", plugins="tskitr")
# Both of the depends and plugins arguments are needed!

# Load a tree sequence
ts_file <- system.file("examples/test.trees", package="tskitr")
ts <- tskitr::ts_load(ts_file)

# Apply the compiled function
ts_num_individuals2(ts)
# [1] 80

# An identical tskitr implementation of the function
ts_num_individuals(ts)
# [1] 80
```

### 3) Call `tskit` C API in C++ code in another R package

Follow the steps below in your R package. To see details of each step, see the files in R package `AlphaSimR` at this [commit](https://github.com/HighlanderLab/AlphaSimR/commit/12657b08e7054d88bc214413d13f36c7cde60d95) (that has proof of concept of using tskit C API).

a) Open `DESCRIPTION` file and add `tskitr` to the `LinkingTo:` field.

b) Add `#include <tskit.h>` as needed to your header files in `src` directory.

c) Call `tskit` C API as needed in your C++ code in `src` directory.

d) Configure your package build with the `tskitr` library using the following steps:

  * Add `src/Makevars.in` and `src/Makevars.win.in` files with `PKG_LIB = @TSKITR_LIB@` flag, in addition to other flags.

  * Add `tools/configure.R` file, which will replace `@TSKITR_LIB@` in `src/Makevars.in` and `src/Makevars.win.in` files with the installed `tskitr` library file, including appropriate flags, and generate `src/Makevars` and `src/Makevars.win`.

  * Add `configure` and `configure.win` shell files (and make them executable) that call `tools/configure.R`.

  * Add `cleanup` and  `cleanup.win` shell files  (and make them executable)that will remove `src/Makevars` and `src/Makevars.win` as well as compilation files.

e) You should now be ready to build, check, and install your package using tools like `devtools::build()`, `devtools::check()`, and `devtools::install()` or their `R CMD` equivalents.

Here is an example:

```
# Install tskitr
remotes::install_github(
  repo = "HighlanderLab/tskitr/tskitr"
)

# Install AlphaSimR
# (commit with proof of concept of using tskit C API;
#  study the file contents in there!)
remotes::install_github(
  repo = "HighlanderLab/AlphaSimR",
  ref = "12657b08e7054d88bc214413d13f36c7cde60d95"
)

# Load packages
library(tskitr)
library(AlphaSimR)

ts_file <- system.file("examples/test.trees", package = "tskitr")
ts <- tskitr::ts_load(ts_file) # slendr also has ts_load()!
tskitr::ts_num_individuals(ts)
# AlphaSimR::ts_num_individuals2(ts)
# the above one doesn't work at the moment due to roxygen2 bug
AlphaSimR:::ts_num_individuals2(ts)
```

### 4) Call `tskit` C API in R code in an R session or another R package

Doable, but do we want/need this? - we would have to write Rcpp wrappers for all the functions in tskit C API. Can this be automated? Would Rcpp module help here?

TODO: Write the STATE_and_AIMS.md file on what we want to achieve with the tskitr package #12
      https://github.com/HighlanderLab/tskitr/issues/12

Think about how we would like to use the code in practice!
