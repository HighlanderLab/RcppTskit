# `RcppTskit`: `R` access to the `tskit C` API

## Overview

<!-- keep in sync with DESCRIPTION file but use `` and Markdown URLs for DOIs -->

`Tskit` enables performant storage, manipulation, and analysis of ancestral
recombination graphs (ARGs) using succinct tree sequence encoding.
The tree sequence encoding of an ARG is
described in Wong et al. (2024)
<[doi:10.1093/genetics/iyae100](https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyae100)>,
while `tskit` project is described in Jeffrey et al. (2026)
<[doi:10.48550/arXiv.2602.09649](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2602.09649)>.
See https://tskit.dev for project news, documentation, and tutorials.
`Tskit` provides `Python`, `C`, and `Rust` application programming interfaces (APIs).
The `Python` API can be called from `R` via the `reticulate` `R` package to
seamlessly load and analyse a tree sequence, as described at
https://tskit.dev/tutorials/RcppTskit.html.
`RcppTskit` provides `R` access to the `tskit C` API for use cases where the
`reticulate` option is not optimal.
For example, for high-performance and low-level work with tree sequences.
Currently, `RcppTskit` provides a limited number of functions
due to the availability of extensive `Python` API and the `reticulate` option.
The provided `RcppTskit R` API mirrors the `tskit Python` API,
while the `RcppTskit C++` API mirrors the `tskit C` API.

See more details on the state of the tree sequence ecosystem and aims of
`RcppTskit` in [the introduction vignette](https://highlanderlab.r-universe.dev/articles/RcppTskit/RcppTskit_intro.html) ([source](RcppTskit/vignettes/RcppTskit_intro.qmd)).
The vignette also shows examples on how to use `RcppTskit` on its own or
to develop new `R` packages that can leverage `RcppTskit`.

## Contents

  * `extern` - Git submodule for `tskit` and instructions on
    obtaining the latest version and copying the `tskit C` code into
    `RcppTskit` directory.
    `extern` is saved outside of the `RcppTskit` directory
    because `R CMD CHECK` complains otherwise (even with `.Rbuildignore`).

  * `RcppTskit` - `R` package `RcppTskit`.

## License

  * See `extern/LICENSE` for `tskit`.

  * See `RcppTskit/LICENSE*` for `RcppTskit`.

## Installation

To install the published release from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppTskit) use:

```
# Install
install.packages("RcppTskit")

# Read the introduction to RcppTskit
vignette("RcppTskit_intro")
```

To install the latest development version (possibly unstable!) from
[R universe](https://r-universe.dev) use:

```
# Install
r_universe_and_cran <- c(
  "https://highlanderlab.r-universe.dev",
  "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
install.packages("RcppTskit", repos = r_universe_and_cran)

# Read the introduction to RcppTskit
vignette("RcppTskit_intro")
```

To install the latest development version (possibly unstable!) from Github
use the following code.
Note that you will have to compile the `C/C++` code and vignette,
so you will require the complete build toolchain,
including compilers, other `R` packages, and `quarto`.
See
https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html#setup-tools for introduction to this topic,
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools for Windows tools, and
https://mac.r-project.org/tools for macOS tools.

```
# install.packages("remotes") # If you don't have it already

# Install the main branch
remotes::install_github("HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/RcppTskit@main",
  build_vignettes=TRUE)

# Install the development branch
remotes::install_github("HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/RcppTskit@devel",
  build_vignettes=TRUE)

# Install a specific release (say, v0.2.0)
remotes::install_github("HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/RcppTskit@v0.2.0")

# Read the introduction to RcppTskit
vignette("RcppTskit_intro")
```

## Development

### Code of Conduct

Please note that the `RcppTskit` project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).
By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

### Clone

First clone the repository and step into the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit.git
cd RcppTskit
```

### Pre-commit install

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to ensure code quality.
Specifically, we use:
* [air](https://github.com/posit-dev/air) to format `R` code,
* [jarl](https://github.com/etiennebacher/jarl) to lint `R` code,
* [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format `C/C++` code, and
* [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) to lint `C/C++` code.

To install the hooks, run:

```
pre-commit install --install-hooks
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

Run these once per clone.
This enables automatic checks on `commit` and `push`.

### tskit

If you plan to update `tskit`, follow instructions in `extern/README.md`.

### RcppTskit

Then open `RcppTskit` package directory in your favourite `R` editor
(Positron, RStudio, text-editor-of-your-choice, etc.) and implement your changes.

You should routinely `R CMD check` your changes (in `R`):

```
# Note that the RcppTskit R package is in the RcppTskit sub-directory
setwd("path/to/RcppTskit/RcppTskit")

# Check
devtools::check()

# Install
devtools::install()

# Test
devtools::test()

# Test coverage
cov <- covr::package_coverage(clean = TRUE)
covr::report(cov)
```

Alternatively check your changes from the command line:

```
# Note that the RcppTskit package is in the RcppTskit sub-directory
cd path/to/RcppTskit/RcppTskit

# Check
R CMD build RcppTskit
R CMD check RcppTskit_*.tar.gz

# Install
R CMD INSTALL RcppTskit_*.tar.gz
```

On Windows, replace `tar.gz` with `zip`.

### Pre-commit run

When committing your changes,
`pre-commit` hooks should kick-in automatically
to ensure code quality.
Manually, you can run them using:

```
pre-commit autoupdate # to update the hooks
pre-commit run # on changed files
pre-commit run --all-files # on all files
pre-commit run <hook_id> # just a specific hook
pre-commit run <hook_id> --all-files # ... on all files
# see also --hook-stage option
```

### Continuous integration

We use Github Actions to run continuous integration (CI) checks
on each push and pull request.
Specifically, we run:
* [R CMD check](.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml) on multiple platforms
  (see curent status [here](https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)),
* [documentation generation](.github/workflows/document.yaml)
  (see current status [here](https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/actions/workflows/document.yaml)),
* [pre-commit hooks](.github/workflows/pre-commit.yaml)
  (see current status [here](https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/actions/workflows/pre-commit.yaml)), and
* [test coverage](.github/workflows/test-coverage.yaml)
  (see current status [here](https://github.com/HighlanderLab/RcppTskit/actions/workflows/test-coverage.yaml)).

[R universe for RcppTskit](https://highlanderlab.r-universe.dev/RcppTskit)
also provides another set of checks - see [here](https://highlanderlab.r-universe.dev/RcppTskit#checktable).
These are provided after new code is pushed or merged into this repository.
