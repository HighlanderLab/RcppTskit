# tskitr: R Package providing access to the tskit C API

Tskit enables performant storage, manipulation and analysis of ancestral
recombination graphs using succinct tree sequence encoding; see https://tskit.dev.
Tskit provides Python, C, and Rust APIs. The Python API can be called from R via
the `reticulate` package to seamlessly load and analyse tree sequences, see
https://tskit.dev/tutorials/tskitr.html.
`tskitr` provides R access to the tskit C API for use cases where the `reticulate`
approach is not suitable. For example, where high-performance and low-level work
with tree sequences is required. R access to the parts of C API is added as the
need arises.
